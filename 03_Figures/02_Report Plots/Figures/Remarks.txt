## Remakrs from Prof. BOURDIN 

### PLOTS 
---> NO UNIQUE PLOTS ACROSS THE REPORT (just maps, just bars, just scatter)

- fig 1 

Bleu clair, --> DONE 

- fig 2 

make it readble across the plots --> DONE 

- fig 3 

Make le decoupage "white" | Exc. mortality map (during the three waves) -->  

- fig 4 
Markov chains: 

- fig 5: 

Spider diag (for clusters)
Add to the clustring (--> Exc. mortality - sum(2020)-) -- just in 2020 -- 

- Animated maps (Weekly): 
	- Cases: case density 
	- Deaths: new deaths/ culumative deaths/
		death rate density/ cumulative death rate	 

- maps --> 

 --->> just the difference difference (iso/choro) 


### QTs 

* Should I stop doing the ecological index for the survey (NUTS1) and continue lookig for 
NUTS3/LAU data? 

* What I'm responsible for exactly? (from the mid-report!) 

* I'll do the standalone maps in choropleth, if we manage to have some time
I'll turn them in isopleth.
