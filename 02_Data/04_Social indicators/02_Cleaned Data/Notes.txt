What we need (for the year of 2020+2021): 

* Population 

* (Un)employment data/rate (espacially for youth) ( we just need working population instead!) 

* Poverity (poverty rate) 

* Social exclusion (share of population at risk of poverity or social exclusion) 

* income (GDP/capita, household income, income inequality)
